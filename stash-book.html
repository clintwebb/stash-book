<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Stash was specifically designed to provide a data storage system suitable for modern websites that need to quickly provide a large amount of small chunks of data.</p>

<p>Websites are normally developed very fluidly.  The data storage system needs to be flexible, and easy to use.</p>

<h2>Goals of the Stash Project</h2>

<p>When designing and developing Stash, there were some specific goals in mind:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>100% uptime</b> - Aside from undetected bugs, the database needs to be up all the time, even when changes need to be made to the database software and libraries themselves.</li>
  <li><b>Automatic Replication</b> - Changes made on the master automatically get replicated to slave servers.</li>
  <li><b>Master and slave ignorant</b> - The client connects to a server, but doesn't know or care if it is a master or a slave.  If it makes any requests that only a master can do, the slave will send the request on.</li>
  <li><b>Type Agnostic</b> - Didn't want to be tied to a particular data-type for a column, if we decide that we need to store a string instead of an integer, we can do so.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Different to SQL</h2>

<p>Stash is a lot different to MySQL, Oracle and other SQL-like databases.  </p>

<h2>Features</h2>


<p>
	The AUTO value.  In SQL it is common to allow key columns to auto-increment the value.   This is a useful unique ID generator.  With Stash, you can indicate that an automatic number be generated.  THe advantage is that when using a single table with content-named rows, you can generate a unique id on the key, even though different types of data is being stored.  This allows a certain flexibility that was not possible before.
